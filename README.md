# Fully-automated-pollution-control-and-traffic-analysis-system

This system is a complete automated system for vehicular emmission control by automating the entire odd even rule implementation inreal time.
It also uses database queries to generate mail and SMS to notify the defaulters.
Live traffic analysis is done by giving the current count of vehicles and in turn giving a result about the traffic situation.
It uses important concepts of Computer Vision and Database Management System.
Individual codes are available in different files.
For complete execution of the project, run the mail.py file.
